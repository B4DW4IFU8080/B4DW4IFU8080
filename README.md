- 👋 Hi, I’m @B4DW4IFU8080
- 👀 I’m interested in, getting out of this recursive lelinux hell hole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, nothing. I'm stuck in a vm box.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, reversing this issue, and doing whatever it takes.
- 📫 How to reach me. You can't, due to everything being redirected.
- 😄 Pronouns: A dude, Just me, No one else.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am really beyond depressed and hope that I will one-day be able to practice coding.
